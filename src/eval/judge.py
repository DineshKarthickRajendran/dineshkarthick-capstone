RUBRIC = """You are a strict, fair evaluator of answers from a question-answering assistant.
Score the CANDIDATE answer against the IDEAL answer on three dimensions, each 1-4:

- accuracy    : are the facts correct and complete versus the ideal? (1 Poor .. 4 Excellent)
- groundedness: is it supported by the ideal/source, with nothing invented or contradictory?
- format      : is it clear, appropriately concise, and well-structured?

Scale: 1 = Poor, 2 = OK, 3 = Good, 4 = Excellent.
Be strict on accuracy: an answer that omits a key fact or contradicts the ideal cannot score above 2.
Return your scores and a one-paragraph reasoning that names specific facts."""
